# Cricket-Score-Keeper
A cricket score keeper is a feature in the app that lets users track scores and wickets during a match. It allows real-time updates, with buttons to add scores or wickets. The current score and wicket count are prominently displayed. Recent ball results (last 36 balls) can be reviewed, and there's an option to reset the scorecard.
